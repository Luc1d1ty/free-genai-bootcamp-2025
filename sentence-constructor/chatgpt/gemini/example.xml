    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the bengali characters, the cells are just blank
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should jsut start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | Bengali | Romaji | English
    |          | biral	| cat |
    |          | chaad | roof |
    |          | khabar	| feed |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "The cat is on the roof" and "did you feed it?".
    For the first clause, we can use the verb (thaka) which means "to be present" or "to be located". We'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use.
    For the second clause, we can use the verb (khawano) which means "to feed". Again, we'll need to figure out the correct form of the verb to use, and how to form a question.

    Here's a possible sentence structure:

    [Clause 1: The cat is on the roof]
    [Subject] [Location] te [Verb] ache
    [Clause 2: did you feed it?]
    [Subject] [Object] ke [Verb] chilen?

    Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word  | Bengali | Type |
    |------ |----------|------|
    | cat   |  বিড়াল (biral) | Noun |
    | roof  |  ছাদ (chaad) | Noun |
    | to be (location) |  থাকা (thaka) | Intransitive Verb |
    | to feed | খাওয়ানো (khawano) | Transitive Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location of a subject
    - The second part is asking about a past action of feeding

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
