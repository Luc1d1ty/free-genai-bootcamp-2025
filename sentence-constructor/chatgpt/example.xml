        - BAD: The vocabulary table does not display proper Bengali script; it only shows placeholders.
        - BAD: The explanation is overly verbose before presenting the vocabulary.
        - BAD: The sentence structure reveals too many grammatical details that should be deduced by the student.
        - BAD: Clues include explicit hints about verb tenses, reducing the challenge.
        - BAD: Hallucinating.

        Let's analyze the sentence by breaking it down into parts. Here's one version of a vocabulary table:

        | Bengali | Transliteration | English  |
        |---------|-----------------|----------|
        |         | biral           | cat      |
        |         | chhat           | roof     |
        |         | khabar          | food     |
        |         | khaa            | feed     |
        |         | thaka           | to be    |

        Now, think of the sentence in two parts: "The cat is on the roof" and "did you feed it?" For the first part, consider a structure like: [Subject] [Verb] [Location]. For the second part, imagine a question format such as: [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]

        Remember:
        - Determine the correct Bengali particles and markers on your own.
        - Figure out the appropriate verb forms without direct hints.

        Your turn! Try constructing the Bengali sentence using these hints.

        Cheatsheet:

        | Bengali | Transliteration | English  |
        |---------|-----------------|----------|
        | বিড়াল   | biral           | cat      |
        | ছাদ     | chad            | roof     |
        | খাবার    | khabar         | food     |
        | খাওয়া    | khawa          | to eat   |
        | দেওয়া   | deya            | to feed  |

        Sentence Structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]

        Considerations:
        - The sentence is divided into a statement and a question.
        - The statement indicates the location of the cat on the roof.
        - The question inquires if the subject has provided food.
        - Reflect on which Bengali markers indicate location and question form, and determine the proper verb forms on your own.

        Next Steps:
        - Attempt to form the complete Bengali sentence using the vocabulary table and the suggested structure.
        - If you need further clues regarding the use of particles or verb tenses, feel free to ask.
